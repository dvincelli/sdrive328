# sdrive328

This is SDrive modified to run on an Arduino UNO R3 (atmega 328)

S-Drive is an Atari 8-bit SIO disk drive emulator targeting an
Atmega 88. I modified it to run on the Atmega 328 and created an 
arduino hat with the missing pieces of the original S-Drive 
schematic.

This was a weekend project I quite enjoyed. At the time, SDrive-MAX 
was not around, which is more polished.
