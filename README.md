# sdrive328

This is SDrive modified to run on an Arduino UNO R3 (atmega 328)

S-Drive is an Atari 8-bit SIO disk drive emulator targeting an
Atmega 88. I modified it to run on the Atmega 328 and created an arduino hat with the missing pieces of the original S-Drive 
schematic.

This was project was a weekend project, at the time I worked on it, SDrive-MAX was not around, which is more polished.
